        <p>
          In 1956, John Lennon formed a skiffle group called The Quarrymen with friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. On July 6, 1957, Paul McCartney joined the band, and in 1958, George Harrison became the lead guitarist.

Their success led the way for the "British Invasion," paving the path for other UK bands in the American market.

        <h3>The Beatles' Breakup and Its Aftermath</h3>
        <p>The Beatles rose to global fame in the 1960s but officially disbanded in 1970. Their breakup began with the sudden death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967, which disrupted the band’s internal balance and direction.

They created Apple Corps but faced major disagreements over management. Paul clashed with the others over who should lead. Creative differences also widened—John leaned toward experimental, political music while Paul preferred classic pop. George and Ringo often felt sidelined.

John Lennon’s relationship with Yoko Ono added tension to the group dynamic. After releasing their final album Abbey Road in 1969, John privately expressed his intent to leave. In 1970, Paul publicly announced his departure, officially ending the band.

Despite the breakup, all four members continued successful solo careers. The Beatles’ legacy remains one of the most influential in music history.

        <h3>Key Albums and Musical Evolution</h3>
        <p>In their later years, The Beatles evolved through bold experimentation and genre expansion. Their 1966 album Revolver is hailed as a psychedelic rock milestone, with "Tomorrow Never Knows" showcasing groundbreaking techniques like tape loops and reverse recording. George Harrison's "Love You To" reflects strong Indian musical influences with sitar and tabla. The 1968 double LP The Beatles (commonly called the White Album) featured an eclectic mix of rock, folk, reggae, and avant-garde, highlighting each member’s individuality. Their final recorded album, Abbey Road (1969), is known for its seamless medley on the B-side, creating a narrative-like flow. The last track, "The End," symbolizes their collaborative spirit, including Ringo Starr’s only drum solo and rotating guitar solos from the other members. These albums mark The Beatles’ transformation from pop sensations into icons of musical innovation.</p>
